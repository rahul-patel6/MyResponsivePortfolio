    <h1>Godot Games</h1>
    <h3>
        Godot games are very useful becuase you can make games that are used by millions of people every
        day. If you learn more about how to make games, it could be your job one day when you get older.
        When you make games, you can use your imagination to create your own characters, backgrounds, and
        heroes. Try, make, and create your own heroes in each godot games!

    <h1>Websites</h1>
    <h3>
        Websites are one of the best things in coding! One of the websites I have made is the one you are
        reading right now. Websites are very difficult but they are worth while because, once you publish it,
        people can read your website and learn more ideas about it. So, you should work on websites and you will
        learn to work harder for things that are worth while!

    <h1>Arduino</h1>
    <h3>
        Arduino is electrical engineering(for kids).There are no dangers in Arduino and it is perfectly safe
        for kids like me. I like Arduino because when I get something wrong then I can always find some way to
        fix it easily. Start doing Arduino!!!
